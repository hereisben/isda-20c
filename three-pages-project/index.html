            Manchester United secured a thrilling 2-1 victory over Chelsea in a
            high-intensity Premier League clash at Old Trafford. The game
            started with United pressing aggressively, and it didn’t take long
            before Bruno Fernandes curled in a stunning free-kick in the 18th
            minute to give the Red Devils an early lead. Chelsea responded with
            a counter-attack, and Raheem Sterling capitalized on a defensive
            lapse to level the score just before halftime.
          </p>
          <p class="desc">
            The second half saw Marcus Rashford and Rasmus Højlund create
            several chances, but Chelsea’s defense held firm. The breakthrough
            came in the 82nd minute when Casemiro rose highest to head in a Luke
            Shaw corner, sending Old Trafford into wild celebrations. Despite
            Chelsea’s late surge, André Onana made a crucial save to deny
            Christopher Nkunku and ensure all three points stayed in Manchester.
          </p>
          <p class="desc">
            This victory keeps United’s top-four hopes alive, bringing them
            level with Tottenham in the Premier League standings. Erik ten Hag
            praised the team’s resilience, especially in the closing stages of
            the match. With a crucial Champions League fixture ahead, United
            will look to carry this momentum forward.

            Transfer Watch: Will Victor Osimhen Be the Next Signing?

          <p class="desc">
            Manchester United are reportedly in advanced talks with Napoli over
            the signing of Victor Osimhen, with the club looking to bolster
            their attacking options. Osimhen, who has scored 18 goals in 24
            games this season, is seen as the ideal striker to lead United’s
            frontline. His pace, strength, and clinical finishing make him one
            of the most sought-after forwards in Europe.
          </p>
          <p class="desc">
            According to sources close to the club, negotiations are progressing
            well, with a potential transfer fee of £100 million being discussed.
            United face competition from Chelsea and PSG, but the player is
            reportedly keen on a move to the Premier League. Erik ten Hag has
            identified Osimhen as a long-term solution to United’s struggles in
            front of goal, particularly after Højlund’s inconsistent
            performances.
          </p>
          <p class="desc">
            If the deal goes through, Osimhen would bring a new dimension to
            United’s attack, forming a lethal partnership with Rashford and
            Fernandes. Fans are excited about the prospect of signing a proven
            goal-scorer, but with Napoli holding firm on their asking price, the
            next few weeks will be crucial in determining whether this
            blockbuster move happens.

          <img
            src="./images/tenhag.jpg"
            alt="Ten Hag's tatical"

          <p class="desc">
            Erik ten Hag has transformed Manchester United’s playing style,
            introducing a high-pressing, possession-based system that demands
            tactical intelligence from his players. His preference for a 4-2-3-1
            formation allows United to control the midfield while ensuring
            defensive stability. Bruno Fernandes plays a pivotal role in this
            setup, acting as the link between midfield and attack.
          </p>
          <p class="desc">
            One of Ten Hag’s biggest tactical strengths is his ability to adapt
            mid-game. Against pressing teams like Liverpool and Arsenal, he has
            used inverted full-backs, allowing more fluidity in buildup play.
            Additionally, the Casemiro-Mainoo midfield pivot has added defensive
            balance, allowing more freedom for attacking players. However,
            injuries have occasionally forced changes, affecting consistency in
            execution.
          </p>
          <p class="desc">
            While United’s pressing game has improved, defensive transitions
            remain a concern. The team has struggled against quick
            counter-attacks, often leaving gaps in behind. To compete with the
            top clubs, Ten Hag must fine-tune United’s defensive discipline
            while maintaining the attacking intensity that has become a
            trademark of his system.

            Injury Report: When Will Lisandro Martínez Return?

          <img

            alt="Lisandro Martinez injury"
            class="thumb"
          />
          <p class="desc">
            Manchester United fans have been eagerly awaiting the return of
            Lisandro Martínez, who has been out since December with a knee
            ligament injury. The Argentine defender has been a key figure in
            United’s backline, providing aggression, leadership, and composure
            in possession. His absence has been felt, particularly with Harry
            Maguire and Victor Lindelöf struggling for consistency.
          </p>
          <p class="desc">
            Martínez has now returned to light training, with United’s medical
            team monitoring his progress closely. While initial reports
            suggested he could be back by early March, Ten Hag has hinted at a
            cautious approach to avoid any setbacks. The upcoming clash against
            Manchester City might come too soon, but there is optimism that he
            could feature in the second leg of the Champions League Round of 16.
          </p>
          <p class="desc">
            United’s defensive record has dipped without Martínez, and his
            return could provide a much-needed boost. His partnership with
            Raphaël Varane was one of the key reasons behind United’s strong
            defensive performances last season. If he regains full fitness in
            time for the crucial run-in, it could significantly impact United’s
            push for a top-four finish.

            Manchester United’s history is filled with iconic goals, moments
            that have defined generations of fans. One of the most memorable
            strikes came in 1999, when Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s last-minute winner
            sealed a historic treble for United in the Champions League final
            against Bayern Munich. That goal epitomized the never-say-die spirit
            of Sir Alex Ferguson’s side.
          </p>
          <p class="desc">
            Another legendary goal belongs to Wayne Rooney, whose bicycle kick
            against Manchester City in 2011 is widely regarded as one of the
            greatest Premier League goals of all time. With the game tied at
            1-1, Nani’s cross found Rooney, who executed a stunning overhead
            kick that left Joe Hart helpless. That goal secured a crucial win in
            the title race and remains one of the most replayed goals in
            United’s history.
          </p>
          <p class="desc">
            More recently, Cristiano Ronaldo’s thunderbolt against Porto in the
            Champions League showcased his incredible ability to score from
            distance. The 40-yard strike remains one of the most powerful goals
            ever seen in European competition. As new stars emerge at Old
            Trafford, the tradition of scoring breathtaking goals continues to
            thrive.

          <p class="desc">
            The 2024/25 season has been a rollercoaster ride for Manchester
            United fans, with moments of brilliance mixed with frustrating
            inconsistency. Many supporters have praised Erik ten Hag’s tactical
            improvements, particularly in midfield control and attacking
            patterns. However, defensive frailties and lapses in concentration
            have left fans questioning whether United can realistically
            challenge for the title.
          </p>
          <p class="desc">
            On social media, fans are divided on certain players. Some believe
            that Bruno Fernandes has been the standout performer, carrying the
            team in crucial games. Others argue that Rasmus Højlund needs more
            time to develop, while some are calling for a more clinical striker
            like Victor Osimhen to be signed. The debate over Maguire’s role in
            the squad also remains heated, with fans split on his performances.
          </p>
          <p class="desc">
            Despite the mixed emotions, the passion among United fans remains as
            strong as ever. Whether celebrating victories or voicing frustration
            after defeats, the global fanbase continues to back the team. With
            the second half of the season still ahead, there is cautious
            optimism that United can secure Champions League qualification and
            potentially lift a domestic trophy.
